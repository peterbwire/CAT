          <h2>My rap</h2>
             <p>Well I ain't never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school
             Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I'm cool and I can get whatever job I wanted
             But the job you wanted wasn't all that bumping
             Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that
             Know you been racing them rats, you ain't been making them raps.Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
           <h2>Another one</h2>
           <p>For example, I can be like ain't nobody fucking with Lil Dicky
              When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
              Ripping this shit like it's never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
              Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit to whatever cadence you bitches prefer.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="column">
           <h2>Thats it</h2>
           <p>Top of that, lyrically I'm pretty damn clever (Go)
              Got a long bottom bitch, called a hoe Neville (Whoa)
              And I blow it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee (Oh)
              You can say I'm pretty smart how I know better
              And y'all been winning like Pistorius, there's no feet.
              Bro, I can go on and on
              I'm taking over any man like father in laws.</p>
